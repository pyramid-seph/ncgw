# Practice Makes Perfect

Submission for Brackeys' Game Jam 2025.1


## About the game
After weeks of rehearsing the famous copy-copy dance it is almost time! 
Just one or two more rehearsals and I'm sure you'll be ready for the real deal! 
I'd wish you luck, but I know you wont need it because with that much practice 
nothing can go wrong... right?!

## How to play
See your leader do some moves, wait for your turn and use your WASD keys to copy 
your leader moves. Don't worry, you don't need to do them as fast as they do. 
Be careful, though!, your leader may throw you a curve ball. 
Nail all steps to see the true ending!
